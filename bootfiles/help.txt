 Welcome to MiniOS.

 Select a pre-configured option from the boot menu, or press [Tab] key to
 manually edit the boot command line in order to customize how MiniOS boots.
 A detailed description of various boot parameters is provided below.

 * toram: If specified, all data are copied to memory during startup so you
   can eject the boot device. Needs enough RAM to store all necessary files.

 * text: If specified, you will be loaded with text mode at startup

 * perchdir=[resume/new/ask/askdir/#]: When MiniOS is started from a writable media,
   all changes are saved to subdirectories of /minios/changes/ to make them
   persistent. This parameter allows you to choose what session to resume.
   Use perchdir=resume to auto resume the session used on previous boot. If askdir
   is specified, you can select the disk where the changes are stored.

 * perchsize=[size_MB]: When stored on non-linux filesystem such as FAT32,
   sessions are limited to maximum size of 16GB. You can increase or decrease the
   limit with this parameter, use for example perchsize=32000 for 32GB or
   perchsize=4000 for 4GB.

 * from=[file/path/device/ask] is used to set a directory or even device from
   which is MiniOS started. For example, from=/minios, from=/dev/sr1/miniosdata
   or even from=http://some_url/to_iso_file.iso

 * load=[regex] is used to specify what modules will be loaded. Use
   a regular expression, for example load=00,01,02 or load=core,minios,kernel,fimware

 * noload=[regex] is used to specify what modules will not be loaded. Use
   a regular expression, for example noload=04-apps or noload=apps|chromium
